# Advance House Price Prediction
In the given problem statement, we are provided with a dataset, 'House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques', containing 80 columns. In the dataset, we can see that many values are missing, and it is highly inconsistent; thus, there's a dire need for Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.
Thus, we'll deal with the problem statement in a two-fold manner:
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analysing the data for missing values, outliers, etc.
2.	Feature Engineering: Filling missing values, handling categorical data, encoding,etc.
3.	Feature Selection: Select features for model training 
4.	Model Building and Accuracy Comparison
